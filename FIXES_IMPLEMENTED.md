# Fixes Implemented

## Summary
Fixed issues with statement parsing in function/subroutine bodies to support control flow statements.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced `parse_statement_in_if_block` function (parser_statements.f90)
- Added support for parsing if statements 
- Added support for stop, return, goto, error stop, cycle, exit statements
- Added support for write, read, allocate, deallocate statements
- This function is used when parsing statements within if blocks and function/subroutine bodies

### 2. Modified function/subroutine body parsing (parser_definition_statements.f90)
- Added special handling for if statements in function bodies
- Function bodies now properly parse if statements using `parse_if` instead of treating them as literals
- Added import for `parse_if` from `parser_control_flow_module`

## Issues Still Present

### 1. Test Execution Bugs
Many tests have unconditional `stop 1` statements that should be conditional. These tests need to be fixed to only call `stop 1` when tests actually fail. However, upon closer inspection, most tests do have proper conditional logic.

### 2. Expression Temporary Tracking
Tests for expression temporary tracking are failing - this appears to be a semantic analysis issue, not a parsing issue.

### 3. Standardization Tests
Some standardization tests are failing, likely due to incomplete implementation of certain transformation features.

### 4. Parameter Attribute Copying
The code to copy parameter attributes from declarations to parameters exists in `merge_parameter_attributes` but may not be working correctly.

## Test Results
- Before fixes: 43 test failures (based on grep count)
- After fixes: 41 test failures
- Successfully fixed: if statement parsing in function bodies (test_parser_if_in_functions now passes)

## Next Steps
1. Verify if statement parsing in function bodies works correctly
2. Fix remaining test failures
3. Investigate expression temporary tracking issues
4. Check parameter attribute copying functionality
