# fortfront Architecture Design - FRAUD-PROOF TECHNICAL VERIFICATION

## ðŸš¨ SPRINT 9: FRAUD-PROOF TECHNICAL VERIFICATION - 2025-08-29

**CURRENT STATUS**: Sprint 8 PRs ready for merge, systematic fraud in completion claims exposed  
**TECHNICAL EVIDENCE**: PR #819 and #820 have passing CI, 9 files still >1000 lines  
**CURRENT GOAL**: Implement fraud-proof technical verification preventing false claims  
**STRATEGIC FOCUS**: Technical verification gates, systematic architectural debt reduction, process integrity

### BUILD SYSTEM STATUS (Recovery Complete)

**CURRENT REALITY** (Verified 2025-08-28):
```bash
# CMAKE SYSTEM WORKING:
mkdir -p cmake_build && cd cmake_build && cmake .. && make
# SUCCESS: Builds fortfront executable successfully

# FPM SYSTEM BROKEN:
fpm test --flag "-cpp -fmax-stack-var-size=524288"
# FAILS: Error: 'is_defined' not member of 'symbol_info_t' structure
```

**RECOVERY ACHIEVED**:
- CMAKE: Module dependencies resolved, main executable building
- FPM: Still broken with symbol_info_t API inconsistency
- DECISION: Continue with CMAKE as primary, fix or deprecate FMP

### SPRINT 9 FRAUD-PROOF VERIFICATION DEFINITION OF DONE

1. **TECHNICAL VERIFICATION GATES**: All completion claims backed by merged PRs and CI evidence
2. **ARCHITECTURAL DEBT MEASURABLE PROGRESS**: Reduce 9 files >1000 lines by at least 3 files
3. **CLI PROFESSIONAL COMPLETION**: Merge ready PRs #819 and #820 with verification
4. **FRAUD-PROOF PROCESS**: Implement mandatory technical evidence for all claims

### SPRINT 9 PRIORITIES (PLAY Fraud Detection Response)

**HIGH PRIORITY - TECHNICAL VERIFICATION IMPLEMENTATION**:
1. **Completion Gates**: No marking complete without merged PR and CI verification
2. **Evidence Requirements**: All claims must include technical proof
3. **Process Integrity**: Implement fraud-proof gates preventing false claims
4. **Sprint 8 Recovery**: Merge ready PRs #819 and #820 with verification

**HIGH PRIORITY - SYSTEMATIC ARCHITECTURAL DEBT**:
1. **9 Files >1000 lines**: parser_import_statements.f90 (1302), variable_usage_tracker.f90 (1238), parser_definition_statements.f90 (1229)
2. **Sprint 9 Target**: Reduce violations from 9 to 6 files (split 3 largest)
3. **Measurable Progress**: Architectural compliance with technical verification

**MEDIUM PRIORITY - DOCUMENTATION INTEGRITY**:
1. **CLAUDE.md Accuracy**: Remove false claims about CMAKE issues
2. **README Status**: Update project termination claims with reality
3. **Technical Claims**: Verify all documentation against working systems

### SPRINT 9 FRAUD-PROOF VERIFICATION STRATEGY

**PHASE 1: Technical Verification Implementation** (HIGH)
- Implement completion gates requiring merged PRs and CI evidence
- Merge Sprint 8 ready PRs #819 and #820 with technical verification
- Establish fraud-proof process preventing false completion claims
- Validate all technical claims with concrete evidence

**PHASE 2: Systematic Architectural Debt Reduction** (HIGH)
- Split 3 largest files: parser_import_statements.f90 (1302), variable_usage_tracker.f90 (1238), parser_definition_statements.f90 (1229)
- Reduce architectural violations from 9 files to 6 files
- Apply proven modular extraction patterns with technical verification

**PHASE 3: Systematic Defect Consolidation** (MEDIUM)
- Verify CLI improvements after PR merges
- Analyze test suite failures vs implementation gaps
- Distinguish real issues from test contamination

**PHASE 4: Fraud-Proof Process Documentation** (MEDIUM)
- Update README project status with technical accuracy
- Document fraud-proof technical verification requirements
- Establish contributor guidelines requiring technical evidence

### ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES (Proven Effective)

**SIZE CONSTRAINTS** (Hard Limits):
- Files: <1000 lines (target <500 lines)
- Functions: <100 lines (target <50 lines)  
- Directories: <30 files (target <15 files)

**QUALITY HIERARCHY**:
CORRECTNESS > PERFORMANCE > KISS > SRP > YAGNI > DRY > SOLID > SECURITY

**REFACTORING STRATEGY** (Proven Successful):
1. **Identify Logical Groupings**: Related functions and types
2. **Extract Specialized Modules**: Clear single responsibilities
3. **Maintain Backward Compatibility**: Through re-exports if needed
4. **Incremental Validation**: Test after each extraction
