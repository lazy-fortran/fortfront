# fortfront Architecture Design - USER EXPERIENCE RECOVERY

## ðŸš¨ SPRINT 8: USER EXPERIENCE RECOVERY - 2025-08-28

**SUCCESS STATUS**: CMAKE build system working, basic compilation restored  
**TECHNICAL EVIDENCE**: CMAKE builds main executable, basic transpilation functional  
**CURRENT GOAL**: Transform working build into professional user experience  
**STRATEGIC FOCUS**: CLI quality, architectural debt, documentation integrity

### BUILD SYSTEM STATUS (Recovery Complete)

**CURRENT REALITY** (Verified 2025-08-28):
```bash
# CMAKE SYSTEM WORKING:
mkdir -p cmake_build && cd cmake_build && cmake .. && make
# SUCCESS: Builds fortfront executable successfully

# FPM SYSTEM BROKEN:
fpm test --flag "-cpp -fmax-stack-var-size=524288"
# FAILS: Error: 'is_defined' not member of 'symbol_info_t' structure
```

**RECOVERY ACHIEVED**:
- CMAKE: Module dependencies resolved, main executable building
- FPM: Still broken with symbol_info_t API inconsistency
- DECISION: Continue with CMAKE as primary, fix or deprecate FMP

### SPRINT 8 USER EXPERIENCE DEFINITION OF DONE

1. **CLI PROFESSIONAL QUALITY**: Clean argument parsing, no debug contamination, proper exit codes
2. **ARCHITECTURAL DEBT REDUCTION**: Address top 3 file size violations (>1000 lines)
3. **BUILD SYSTEM UNITY**: Either fix FPM or officially deprecate to CMAKE-only
4. **DOCUMENTATION INTEGRITY**: Remove all false claims from project documentation

### SPRINT 8 PRIORITIES (PLAY Audit Consolidated)

**HIGH PRIORITY - CLI PROFESSIONAL QUALITY**:
1. **Debug Contamination**: Excessive debug output breaks pipeline usage
2. **Exit Code Standards**: STOP 0 violations break CLI conventions
3. **Argument Parsing**: Catastrophic failures on standard shell patterns
4. **User Experience**: Transform from development tool to professional CLI

**MEDIUM PRIORITY - ARCHITECTURAL DEBT**:
1. **8 Files >1000 lines**: parser_import_statements.f90 (1302), variable_usage_tracker.f90 (1238), etc.
2. **Directory Organization**: src/ has 26 items (target: <15)
3. **Build System Unity**: FPM broken, CMAKE working - choose path forward

**MEDIUM PRIORITY - DOCUMENTATION INTEGRITY**:
1. **CLAUDE.md Accuracy**: Remove false claims about CMAKE issues
2. **README Status**: Update project termination claims with reality
3. **Technical Claims**: Verify all documentation against working systems

### SPRINT 8 USER EXPERIENCE STRATEGY

**PHASE 1: CLI Professional Quality** (HIGH)
- Eliminate debug output contamination from normal operation
- Replace STOP 0 calls with proper program termination and exit codes
- Fix catastrophic argument parsing failures on standard patterns
- Transform CLI from development prototype to professional tool

**PHASE 2: Architectural Debt Reduction** (MEDIUM)
- Target top 3 largest files exceeding 1000 lines for refactoring
- Begin systematic directory organization improvements
- Apply proven modular extraction patterns from previous sprints

**PHASE 3: Build System Unity** (MEDIUM)
- Decision: Fix FPM symbol API inconsistencies OR deprecate to CMAKE-only
- Simplify build instructions for new contributors
- Ensure single reliable build path going forward

**PHASE 4: Documentation Integrity** (MEDIUM)
- Remove false claims about CMAKE issues from CLAUDE.md
- Update README project status to reflect active development
- Verify all technical documentation against working systems

### ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES (Proven Effective)

**SIZE CONSTRAINTS** (Hard Limits):
- Files: <1000 lines (target <500 lines)
- Functions: <100 lines (target <50 lines)  
- Directories: <30 files (target <15 files)

**QUALITY HIERARCHY**:
CORRECTNESS > PERFORMANCE > KISS > SRP > YAGNI > DRY > SOLID > SECURITY

**REFACTORING STRATEGY** (Proven Successful):
1. **Identify Logical Groupings**: Related functions and types
2. **Extract Specialized Modules**: Clear single responsibilities
3. **Maintain Backward Compatibility**: Through re-exports if needed
4. **Incremental Validation**: Test after each extraction

### SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR USER EXPERIENCE RECOVERY

**CLI PROFESSIONAL QUALITY**:
- [ ] fortfront operates cleanly in shell pipelines (no debug contamination)
- [ ] proper UNIX exit codes replace STOP 0 violations
- [ ] standard argument parsing patterns work correctly
- [ ] CLI help and error messages follow professional standards

**ARCHITECTURAL DEBT PROGRESS**:
- [ ] Top 3 largest files (>1000 lines) reduced to compliant size
- [ ] Directory organization improved (src/ from 26 to <20 items)
- [ ] Modular extraction patterns applied consistently
- [ ] Clear architectural improvement trajectory established

**BUILD SYSTEM CLARITY**:
- [ ] Single reliable build path for new contributors
- [ ] FPM either fixed to match CMAKE or officially deprecated
- [ ] Build instructions simplified and verified

**DOCUMENTATION INTEGRITY**:
- [ ] All false claims removed from project documentation
- [ ] Technical reality accurately reflected in guides
- [ ] New contributor onboarding improved

## User Experience Recovery Approach

**PRINCIPLE**: Transform working build system into professional user experience  
**APPROACH**: CLI quality first, then systematic architectural improvements  
**OUTCOME**: Fortfront becomes professional tool suitable for real-world usage

*Sprint 8 builds on CMAKE recovery success, focusing on user experience and beginning systematic architectural debt reduction using proven modular extraction patterns.*
