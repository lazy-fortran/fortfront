# fortfront Architecture Design - FRAUD-PROOF TECHNICAL VERIFICATION

## ðŸš¨ SPRINT 10: EMERGENCY SYSTEM RECOVERY - 2025-08-29

**CURRENT STATUS**: EMERGENCY - Circular dependency blocks ALL test verification, system recovery required
**TECHNICAL EVIDENCE**: STOP 1 error in ./test.sh blocks verification, 271 STOP violations remain despite PR claims
**CURRENT GOAL**: Fix test system blocker, restore verification capability, enable development process
**STRATEGIC FOCUS**: Emergency recovery priority - test verification first, then fraud cleanup

### BUILD SYSTEM STATUS (Recovery Complete)

**CURRENT REALITY** (Verified 2025-08-29):
```bash
# FMP BUILD SYSTEM: WORKING 
./build.sh
# SUCCESS: "Project is up to date" - builds fine

# FMP TEST SYSTEM: CATASTROPHIC FAILURE
./test.sh
# FAILURE: Circular dependency STOP 1 blocks all tests

# CMAKE SYSTEM: UNVERIFIED
# Previous claims of working CMAKE need verification
```

**FRAUD DETECTION RESULTS**:
- FMP BUILD: Working (contrary to BACKLOG.md claims of broken)
- FMP TEST: Catastrophic circular dependency failure blocking verification
- STOP REMOVAL: MASSIVE FRAUD - 271 violations remain vs PR #819 complete removal claims
- ARCHITECTURAL DATA: Systematically false file size data misdirecting development

### SPRINT 10 EMERGENCY SYSTEM RECOVERY DEFINITION OF DONE

1. **EMERGENCY TEST RECOVERY**: Fix circular dependency STOP 1 error - test suite executes without immediate crash
2. **VERIFICATION RESTORATION**: Basic test verification capability enabled for quality assurance
3. **FRAUD CLEANUP**: Address 271 STOP violations fraud and correct false architectural documentation  
4. **DEVELOPMENT CAPABILITY**: Working test system enables continued development and verification

### SPRINT 10 PRIORITIES (Emergency Recovery Focus)

**EMERGENCY PRIORITY - TEST SYSTEM RECOVERY**:
1. **STOP 1 Blocker**: Fix circular dependency enabling test execution
2. **Verification Capability**: Restore basic test verification for quality assurance
3. **Development Foundation**: Enable continued work through working test system
4. **Quality Gates**: Re-establish verification capability for all future work

**CRITICAL PRIORITY - FRAUD ELIMINATION**:
1. **STOP Fraud**: Address 271 violations vs PR #819 false completion claims
2. **Data Accuracy**: Correct false file size claims misdirecting architectural work
3. **Technical Reality**: Replace fraudulent claims with measured verification
4. **Process Integrity**: Prevent future false technical claims

**HIGH PRIORITY - REAL ARCHITECTURAL DEBT**:
1. **MEASURED Violations**: ast_nodes_control.f90 (1169), parser_expressions.f90 (1162), cfg_builder.f90 (1079)
2. **Reality-Based Planning**: Use actual measured data vs false documentation claims
3. **Emergency First**: Fix test blocker before architectural improvements
4. **Proven Patterns**: Apply successful modular extraction after recovery

**MEDIUM PRIORITY - CORE FUNCTIONALITY RECOVERY**:
1. **Parser Regressions**: Fix assignment and print statement generation failures
2. **Operator Parsing**: Restore semicolon statement separation functionality
3. **Basic Features**: Ensure fundamental Fortran constructs work correctly
4. **CLI Quality**: Maintain working CLI functionality during recovery

### SPRINT 10 EMERGENCY SYSTEM RECOVERY STRATEGY

**PHASE 1: Emergency Test System Recovery** (CRITICAL)
- Fix circular dependency STOP 1 error blocking ALL test verification
- Restore basic test suite execution without immediate crashes
- Enable quality verification capability for continued development
- Emergency dependency resolution in variable_usage_collector.f90 modules

**PHASE 2: Massive Fraud Correction** (CRITICAL)
- Address 271 STOP violations remaining despite PR #819 false completion claims
- Implement actual STOP removal vs fraudulent completion marking
- Restore technical integrity through verified STOP elimination
- Document fraud detection and prevention for future development

**PHASE 3: Architectural Data Reality Correction** (HIGH)
- Correct false file size claims in BACKLOG.md with measured wc -l data
- Update README removing false termination claims vs working CLI reality
- Base all architectural planning on verified technical measurements
- Replace systematically fraudulent documentation with technical reality

**PHASE 4: Real Architectural Debt Reduction** (HIGH)
- Split MEASURED largest files: ast_nodes_control.f90 (1169), parser_expressions.f90 (1162), cfg_builder.f90 (1079)
- Apply proven modular extraction patterns after test system recovery
- Use successful ast_factory split as architectural template
- Focus on real violations vs false documentation claims

### ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES (Proven Effective)

**SIZE CONSTRAINTS** (Hard Limits):
- Files: <1000 lines (target <500 lines)
- Functions: <100 lines (target <50 lines)  
- Directories: <30 files (target <15 files)

**QUALITY HIERARCHY**:
CORRECTNESS > PERFORMANCE > KISS > SRP > YAGNI > DRY > SOLID > SECURITY

**REFACTORING STRATEGY** (Proven Successful):
1. **Identify Logical Groupings**: Related functions and types
2. **Extract Specialized Modules**: Clear single responsibilities
3. **Maintain Backward Compatibility**: Through re-exports if needed
4. **Incremental Validation**: Test after each extraction
