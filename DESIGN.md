# fortfront Architecture Design - ARCHITECTURAL RECOVERY

## ðŸš€ SPRINT 5: ARCHITECTURAL INTEGRITY RECOVERY - 2025-08-28

**RECOVERY STATUS**: CMAKE build system successfully implemented and functional  
**CURRENT FOCUS**: Address CRITICAL architectural violations discovered in PLAY phase  
**STRATEGIC GOAL**: Restore architectural compliance while maintaining functional build system  
**TEAM CAPABILITY**: Proven through successful CMAKE migration and FPM crisis resolution

### BUILD SYSTEM SUCCESS (Resolved Crisis)

**SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: CMAKE build system with json-fortran integration
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make -j$(nproc)
ctest  # Full test suite execution
```

**ACHIEVEMENTS**:
- FPM dependency eliminated (abandoned as unfixable)
- CMAKE build working with proper compiler flags
- Source code compilation errors resolved
- json-fortran dependency integrated via FetchContent
- Build system crisis officially RESOLVED

### CURRENT SPRINT DEFINITION OF DONE

1. **FMP TEST EXECUTION RESTORED**: All tests runnable via FMP with proper flags
2. **ast_factory.f90 REFACTORED**: Below 1000-line limit via logical module extraction  
3. **SIZE COMPLIANCE RESTORED**: All 10 files violating 1000-line limit addressed
4. **DIRECTORY REORGANIZATION**: All directories under architectural limits (<30 files)

### ARCHITECTURAL VIOLATIONS TO ADDRESS

**CRITICAL SIZE VIOLATIONS** (From PLAY Phase Audit):
1. **ast_factory.f90**: 1911 lines (91% over hard limit) - WORST VIOLATION
2. **10 Additional Files**: All exceed 1000-line hard limit
3. **Directory Pollution**: 4 directories exceed organizational limits
4. **Test System Defect**: FMP test execution reliability issues with build flags

### SPRINT 5 STRATEGY

**PHASE 1: Build System Reliability**
- Fix FMP test execution with proper compiler flags
- Validate full test suite execution via `fmp test --flag "-cpp -fmax-stack-var-size=524288"`
- Ensure CI reliability with FMP-based testing

**PHASE 2: Emergency Size Refactoring**  
- ast_factory.f90 module extraction (highest priority)
- Systematic refactoring of 10 oversized files
- Apply proven extraction patterns from previous successes

**PHASE 3: Directory Organization**
- Reorganize src/ directory (40 files â†’ compliant structure)
- Reorganize src/semantic/ (36 files â†’ under limits)
- Address src/ast/ and src/parser/ directory pollution

**PHASE 4: Minor Cleanup**
- Resolve duplicate filename confusion
- Final architectural compliance validation

### ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES (Proven Effective)

**SIZE CONSTRAINTS** (Hard Limits):
- Files: <1000 lines (target <500 lines)
- Functions: <100 lines (target <50 lines)  
- Directories: <30 files (target <15 files)

**QUALITY HIERARCHY**:
CORRECTNESS > PERFORMANCE > KISS > SRP > YAGNI > DRY > SOLID > SECURITY

**REFACTORING STRATEGY** (Proven Successful):
1. **Identify Logical Groupings**: Related functions and types
2. **Extract Specialized Modules**: Clear single responsibilities
3. **Maintain Backward Compatibility**: Through re-exports if needed
4. **Incremental Validation**: Test after each extraction

### SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR SPRINT 5

**ARCHITECTURAL COMPLIANCE**:
- [ ] All files <1000 lines (0 violations)
- [ ] All directories <30 files (0 violations)  
- [ ] FMP test execution works reliably (100% test discovery via FMP)
- [ ] Build system reliability maintained

**DEVELOPMENT READINESS**:
- [ ] New contributors can build successfully
- [ ] Full test suite runs reliably
- [ ] Architectural foundation ready for feature development
- [ ] Team capability proven through successful architectural recovery

## Architectural Recovery Approach

**PRINCIPLE**: Restore architectural integrity while preserving functional progress  
**APPROACH**: Systematic refactoring with proven patterns and incremental validation  
**OUTCOME**: Compliant codebase ready for sustainable development expansion

*This architectural recovery builds on successful CMAKE migration and addresses systematic violations identified through rigorous PLAY phase auditing.*
