# ⚠️ WARNING: ARCHITECTURAL FANTASY DOCUMENTATION

## DO NOT IMPLEMENT ANYTHING IN THIS FOLDER

**CRITICAL**: The documents in this DOCS/ folder describe unimplementable architecture that is **BEYOND TEAM CAPABILITY**.

## What These Documents Contain

- **AST_ARENA_*.md** - Complex arena memory management (team cannot implement)
- **AST_MIGRATION*.md** - Migration to arena system (unnecessary complexity)
- **MEMORY_SAFETY_ANALYSIS.md** - Advanced memory management (beyond team skill)
- **SEMANTIC_PIPELINE_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Overengineered pipeline (too complex)

## Why They Still Exist

These documents remain for historical reference only. They represent architectural dreams that paralyzed development.

## What You Should Do Instead

1. **IGNORE** these documents completely
2. **FOCUS** on basic lexer-parser-codegen functionality
3. **READ** DESIGN.md for realistic architecture
4. **IMPLEMENT** only what's achievable

## Team Reality Check

**CAN DO**: Basic parsing, simple AST, direct code generation
**CANNOT DO**: Arena memory, advanced type systems, complex pipelines
