# Development Backlog

## DOING (Current Work)
- [ ] CRITICAL SYSTEM-WIDE REGRESSION: Arena modernization PRs (#455, #459) cause infinite timeout loops across entire test suite (HANDOFF TO SERGEI)

**ðŸš¨ URGENT: SYSTEM-WIDE CRITICAL FAILURE**
- **Scope**: Affects main branch AND all feature branches (not just PR #460)
- **Symptoms**: Tests timeout with infinite "STOP 0" loops, segmentation faults, CI failures
- **Root Cause**: Arena modernization work from PRs #455, #459 introduced architectural instability
- **Impact**: BLOCKING all development - entire test suite non-functional
- **Action**: IMMEDIATE SERGEI ATTENTION required for system architecture fix

## TODO (Ordered by Priority)

### CRITICAL: Foundation Architecture (BLOCKING ALL OTHER WORK)
No remaining items - Foundation architecture complete

### Foundation Phase 1: Error Handling Infrastructure (CRITICAL)
No remaining items - Phase 1 complete

### Foundation Phase 2: Arena System (Foundation complete, continuing development)
No remaining items - Phase 2 development continuing

### Foundation Phase 3: CST/AST Infrastructure (BLOCKED until #442 complete)
- [ ] #394: CST: Implement UID generation system for stable node identification  
- [ ] #395: CST: Implement lexer trivia collection for comments and whitespace
- [ ] #396: CST: Create CST builder for parallel construction alongside AST
- [ ] #397: CST: Implement CST to AST converter with bidirectional linking

### Code Quality and Refactoring (ENHANCEMENT)
- [ ] #448: refactor: reduce function sizes in bench_arena_comparison.f90
- [ ] #407: Refactor: Extract multi-variable declaration handling from parse_declaration (Re-opened after regression fixes needed)
- [ ] #406: Refactor: Extract variable parsing and initialization logic from parse_declaration
- [ ] #364: refactor: break down parse_declaration function (519 lines -> <100 lines)
- [ ] #365: refactor: break down large functions >200 lines (9 functions)
- [ ] #366: refactor: address remaining 24 functions exceeding 100-line limit
- [ ] #367: refactor: address remaining large files >1000 lines

### Type System Improvements (ENHANCEMENT)
- [ ] #401: Type System: Implement constraint generation for Hindley-Milner type inference
- [ ] #402: Type System: Implement unification algorithm with occurs check for constraint solving
- [ ] #403: Type System: Implement constraint solver with let-polymorphism support

### Repository Maintenance (SUPPORT)
- [ ] #439: fix: rescue commits from main (repository hygiene - rescue branch cleanup)

### Testing and Documentation (SUPPORT)
- [ ] #456: Get rid of disabled tests. Either adapt to current system and enable, or delete if obsoleted
- [ ] #450: test: re-enable temporarily disabled tests for issues #4 and #321
- [ ] #451: test: complete AST arena integration test coverage
- [ ] #452: feature: restore debug output capabilities in frontend compilation pipeline
- [ ] #361: Create GCC Bug 114612 test suite and permanent regression prevention

### Epic Planning and Architecture (FUTURE WORK)
- [ ] #392: epic: CST/AST Split Implementation - Complete Migration Plan
- [ ] #391: feat: CST Phase 5 - Implement advanced CST/AST features and external tool integration  
- [ ] #390: feat: CST Phase 4 - Remove legacy code and optimize CST/AST system

- [ ] #388: feat: CST Phase 2 - Implement CST to AST converter with bidirectional links
- [ ] #387: feat: CST Phase 1 - Implement parallel CST construction alongside existing AST
- [ ] #386: feat: CST Phase 0 - Create foundation infrastructure for CST/AST split
- [ ] #385: feat: complete Hindley-Milner type inference with constraint solving
- [ ] #384: feat: implement concrete syntax tree (CST) with trivia preservation
- [ ] #383: epic: unified arena architecture implementation roadmap
- [ ] #382: test: comprehensive arena testing suite
- [ ] #381: doc: create comprehensive arena architecture documentation
