# Development Backlog - USER EXPERIENCE RECOVERY SPRINT

## ðŸš¨ SPRINT 8: USER EXPERIENCE RECOVERY - 2025-08-28 [Epic #817]

**GOAL**: Transform working CMAKE build into professional user experience  
**BUILD STATUS**: CMAKE working (verified), FMP broken (compilation errors)
**TECHNICAL EVIDENCE**: CMAKE builds successful (4.8MB executable), FMP test_semantic_integration.f90 fails
**CI ISSUE**: PR #801 blocked by FMP test expectations while CMAKE functionality works
**FOCUS AREAS**: CLI quality, architectural debt, FMP vs CMAKE decision

**SPRINT DEFINITION OF DONE**:
1. **CLI PROFESSIONAL QUALITY**: Clean argument parsing, no debug contamination, proper exit codes
2. **ARCHITECTURAL DEBT REDUCTION**: Address top 3 file size violations (>1000 lines)
3. **BUILD SYSTEM UNITY**: Either fix FMP or officially deprecate to CMAKE-only
4. **DOCUMENTATION INTEGRITY**: Remove all false claims from project documentation

## DOING (Active Work)

<!-- Issue #806 COMPLETED in PR #819 -->

## SPRINT_BACKLOG - USER EXPERIENCE RECOVERY

### EPIC: CLI PROFESSIONAL QUALITY

<!-- Moved to DOING: #805 -->
<!-- Moved to DOING: #806 --> 

- [ ] #807: Catastrophic argument parsing breaks shell integration
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: Argument parser fails on standard CLI patterns  
  - **IMPACT**: Cannot use standard file input patterns
  - **PRIORITY**: HIGH - basic usability failure


### EPIC: ARCHITECTURAL DEBT REDUCTION

- [ ] #813: 8 files exceed 1000-line architectural limit
  - **LARGEST VIOLATIONS**: parser_import_statements.f90 (1302 lines), variable_usage_tracker.f90 (1238 lines)
  - **TECHNICAL EVIDENCE**: Verified via line count analysis
  - **PRIORITY**: MEDIUM - long-term maintainability impact

- [ ] #788: Fundamental code organization principles violated
  - **SCOPE**: Directory organization (26 items in src/), module extraction strategy
  - **IMPACT**: Maintenance complexity, development velocity reduction
  - **PRIORITY**: MEDIUM - systematic organizational improvements

### EPIC: BUILD SYSTEM UNIFICATION

- [ ] #815: FMP build system - Symbol API inconsistency blocks test execution
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: symbol_info_t API mismatch between modules
  - **CHOICE**: Either fix FMP to match CMAKE or deprecate FMP entirely
  - **PRIORITY**: MEDIUM - CMAKE works, FMP broken since Sprint 7

- [ ] #803: FMP test compilation errors in test_semantic_integration.f90
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: Broken FMP build dependencies after CMAKE migration
  - **CHOICE**: Fix FMP compatibility or remove FMP support
  - **PRIORITY**: MEDIUM - affects test coverage reporting

### EPIC: DOCUMENTATION INTEGRITY

- [ ] #808: CLAUDE.md falsely claims CMAKE has issues while it works
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: Documentation contradicts technical reality
  - **IMPACT**: Confuses new contributors about build system status
  - **PRIORITY**: MEDIUM - accuracy essential for onboarding

- [ ] #809: README falsely claims project terminated while fully functional
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: Outdated termination claims despite active development
  - **IMPACT**: Misleads potential users about project status
  - **PRIORITY**: MEDIUM - project perception and adoption

- [ ] #804: Systematic false claims about test recovery
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: Claims about test fixes without verification
  - **IMPACT**: Technical credibility, contributor trust
  - **PRIORITY**: LOW - primarily historical accuracy

## SPRINT 8 NOTES (Workflow Management)

**SPRINT 8 STRATEGY**:
- Focus on USER EXPERIENCE after CMAKE recovery success
- Address CLI quality issues that prevent professional usage
- Begin systematic architectural debt reduction
- Choose between FMP fix vs CMAKE-only strategy

**DEFERRED ITEMS**:
- Complex semantic analysis bugs (type inference, concatenation) - Sprint 9+
- Legacy issue cleanup - maintain current system stability
- Performance optimizations - functionality first
