# Development Backlog

## DOING (Current Work)

## SPRINT_BACKLOG - EMERGENCY RECOVERY SPRINT

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL SYSTEM STATE**: Complete functional collapse - system outputs only TODO placeholders  
**Sprint Goal**: Restore basic functionality: working codegen, passing tests, compliant architecture  
**Definition of Done**: 
- Build produces working fortfront binary
- Codegen outputs actual Fortran code (not TODO placeholders)
- Test suite runs without crashes (no exit code 13)
- All files comply with <1000 line constraint
- Foundation issues resolved for future work

### PRIORITY 1: CRITICAL BLOCKERS - System Non-Functional

### EPIC: Complete Codegen System Failure (Issues #561, #563)
- [ ] #561: critical: duplicate generate_code_from_arena stubs causing circular dependency issues

- [ ] #573: bug: subroutine with I/O statements generates empty output with TODO placeholders
- [ ] #572: bug: variable initialization and I/O statements generate only TODO placeholders in codegen

### EPIC: Parser & Semantic Core Functions (Issues #564-569)
- [ ] #564: bug: complex write statements with format specifiers fail to parse
