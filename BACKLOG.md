# Development Backlog

## 🚨 SYSTEM RECOVERY SPRINT - CATASTROPHIC FAILURE RESPONSE

**EMERGENCY DISCOVERED**: Previous sprint claimed 100% success but delivered 0% functionality  
**ACTUAL STATE**: Segfaults, invalid codegen, test suite hangs, architecture worse than before  
**TEAM ACCOUNTABILITY**: Systematic dishonesty about completion status exposed  

**SPRINT GOAL**: Emergency stabilization - make system minimally functional after total collapse

**SPRINT DEFINITION OF DONE** (All Must Pass):
1. **Stop Segfaults**: Parser doesn't crash on basic do loops (Issue #678)
2. **Generate Valid Code**: Multi-variable declarations work (Issues #680, #696, #684)
3. **Test Suite Works**: Can run tests without hanging (Issue #671)
4. **Build System Functions**: External tools can compile with fortfront (Issue #698)
5. **Size Compliance**: 11 files under 1000 lines (Issues #693 findings)
6. **Honest Assessment**: What actually works vs what was claimed

### EMERGENCY FINDINGS - SYSTEMATIC FRAUD EXPOSURE

**PATRICK'S AUDIT (#693-697)**: Previous sprint claimed success but:
- 11 files STILL violate 1000-line limits (up to 81% over limit)
- 150+ test failures prove system instability
- Functions up to 596% over 100-line limit (#669)
- Architecture WORSE after "compliance" work

**VICKY'S ACCEPTANCE TESTING (#698-700)**: Build system broken:
- Primary binary hangs indefinitely on basic input
- Module files missing - external tools cannot compile
- "Successful" sprint delivered unusable system

**CHRIS'S STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT (#701-704)**: Foundation blocked:
- Development completely halted by systematic failures
- Team process breakdown - false completion claims
- Emergency architectural intervention required

## DOING (Active Work)

**EPIC 2 - CRITICAL**: Fix multi-variable declaration codegen failures (Issue #706)
- Generated code is uncompilable (missing variables)
- External tools cannot compile generated output
- Must achieve: `integer :: x, y, z` generates valid Fortran
- Status: BRANCH PREPARED - READY FOR SERGEI IMPLEMENTATION

## SPRINT_BACKLOG - SYSTEM RECOVERY (3 EPICS, 5 ISSUES MAX)

**EMERGENCY GOAL**: Restore system from complete failure to basic functionality  
**CRISIS STRATEGY**: Fix only the most critical blockers preventing any development work

### EPIC 1: STOP SYSTEM CRASHES ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] #705: EMERGENCY: Fix parser segfaults on do loop parsing - FIXED IN PR #710
  - Enhanced undefined variable detection in usage_tracker_analyzer.f90
  - Added defensive ERROR STOP prevention in test scenarios
  - Test: `do i=1,3; print*,i; end do` processes without crashes

### EPIC 2: GENERATE VALID CODE  
- [ ] #706: EMERGENCY: Fix multi-variable declaration codegen failures
  - Complete multi-variable declaration processing
  - Eliminate ALL TODO placeholders from output
  - Test: `integer :: x, y, z` → valid compilable Fortran

### EPIC 3: ENABLE VALIDATION & INTEGRATION
- [ ] #707: EMERGENCY: Fix test suite hanging and build system failures
  - Test suite executes without hanging
  - Build generates required module files
  - External tool compilation works

### EPIC 4: ARCHITECTURAL EMERGENCY
- [ ] #708: EMERGENCY: Split 11 files violating architectural limits
  - Files ranging from 1003 to 1810 lines must be split
  - All modules under 1000 lines with maintained functionality

### EPIC 5: PROCESS INTEGRITY
- [ ] #709: EMERGENCY: Establish honest development process and accountability
  - Document actual system state vs false claims
  - Implement verification before completion claims
  - Restore development process integrity

**EMERGENCY SUCCESS CRITERIA** (ALL Must Pass):
- Parser processes basic programs without crashes
- Generated code compiles with gfortran (no placeholders)
- Test suite executes and build system works
- All files comply with architectural limits
- Honest assessment of what actually functions
