<!-- Issue #807 COMPLETED in PR #820 -->

## SPRINT_BACKLOG - FRAUD-PROOF TECHNICAL VERIFICATION

### EPIC: TECHNICAL VERIFICATION IMPLEMENTATION

- [ ] #827: Systematic Sprint 8 failure analysis - implement technical verification
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: False completion claims without merged PRs and CI verification
  - **SOLUTION**: Implement technical gates preventing completion fraud
  - **PRIORITY**: HIGH - process integrity essential

- [ ] Merge ready PRs with technical verification
  - **PR #819**: STOP statement removal (CI passing)
  - **PR #820**: CLI argument validation (CI passing) 
  - **VERIFICATION**: Confirm CI status, merge, validate functionality
  - **PRIORITY**: HIGH - complete Sprint 8 CLI improvements

### EPIC: ARCHITECTURAL DEBT SYSTEMATIC REDUCTION

- [ ] #826: 9 files exceed 1000-line architectural limit (updated count)
  - **LARGEST VIOLATIONS**: parser_import_statements.f90 (1302 lines), variable_usage_tracker.f90 (1238 lines), parser_definition_statements.f90 (1229 lines)
  - **SPRINT 9 TARGET**: Reduce to 6 files (split 3 largest)
  - **TECHNICAL EVIDENCE**: Current violation count verified
  - **PRIORITY**: HIGH - systematic architectural improvement

- [ ] Split parser_import_statements.f90 (1302 lines â†’ <1000)
  - **STRATEGY**: Extract import resolution, syntax validation, dependency tracking
  - **TARGET**: 3-4 focused modules under 500 lines each
  - **PRIORITY**: HIGH - largest violation

- [ ] Split variable_usage_tracker.f90 (1238 lines â†’ <1000)  
  - **STRATEGY**: Extract usage analysis, scope tracking, reference resolution
  - **TARGET**: 2-3 specialized modules under 500 lines each
  - **PRIORITY**: HIGH - second largest violation

### EPIC: SYSTEMATIC DEFECT CONSOLIDATION

- [ ] #823: STOP statements in test output despite PR #819
  - **SCOPE**: Test suite contamination vs CLI application
  - **VERIFICATION**: Test suite may retain STOP in test files (different from CLI)
  - **PRIORITY**: MEDIUM - verify if test contamination is separate issue

- [ ] #825: CLI quality verification after PR merges
  - **VERIFICATION**: Confirm professional CLI behavior after PR #819/#820 merge
  - **TESTING**: Manual verification of argument parsing, exit codes
  - **PRIORITY**: MEDIUM - validate Sprint 8 CLI improvements

- [ ] #824: Test suite failures analysis
  - **SCOPE**: Identify test failures vs functionality gaps
  - **APPROACH**: Categorize failures (test bugs vs implementation gaps)
  - **PRIORITY**: MEDIUM - distinguish real issues from test problems

### EPIC: FRAUD-PROOF PROCESS IMPLEMENTATION

- [ ] Implement technical verification gates
  - **COMPLETION GATE**: No marking complete without merged PR
  - **CI GATE**: No PR merge without passing CI
  - **EVIDENCE GATE**: All claims must include technical verification
  - **PRIORITY**: HIGH - prevent systematic fraud

- [ ] #809: README project status correction
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: Outdated termination claims despite active development
  - **SOLUTION**: Update status to reflect current functional state
  - **PRIORITY**: MEDIUM - project credibility

- [ ] Documentation accuracy audit
  - **SCOPE**: Verify all technical claims in CLAUDE.md, README
  - **APPROACH**: Cross-reference documentation with actual system state
  - **PRIORITY**: MEDIUM - contributor onboarding accuracy

## SPRINT 9 NOTES (Fraud-Proof Technical Verification)

**SPRINT 9 STRATEGY**:
- TECHNICAL VERIFICATION FIRST: All claims must be backed by merged PRs and CI evidence
- SYSTEMATIC ARCHITECTURAL DEBT: Measurable progress on largest violations
- PROCESS INTEGRITY: Implement fraud-proof gates preventing false completion claims
- QUALITY OVER VELOCITY: Better to complete 3 verified tasks than claim 10 false ones

**DEFERRED ITEMS**:
- Complex semantic analysis bugs (type inference, concatenation) - Sprint 10+
- FMP build system repair - CMAKE working, low priority
- Performance optimizations - architectural compliance first
- Legacy issue cleanup - focus on measurable architectural progress
