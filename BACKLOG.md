# Development Backlog - EMERGENCY RECOVERY SPRINT

## ðŸš¨ SPRINT 6: EMERGENCY SYSTEM RECOVERY - 2025-08-28

**EMERGENCY GOAL**: Restore basic functionality to enable development work
**CRISIS STATUS**: ALL build systems broken, development completely blocked
**VERIFIED DEFECTS**: 7 critical system-breaking defects with technical evidence
**RECOVERY PRIORITY**: Fix compilation blockers first, then architectural cleanup

**SPRINT DEFINITION OF DONE**:
1. **BUILD SYSTEM RESTORED**: Either CMAKE or FPM works for basic compilation
2. **SYMBOL API CONSISTENCY**: symbol_info_t type definition conflicts resolved
3. **BASIC FUNCTIONALITY**: fortfront executable works with --version flag
4. **DOCUMENTATION ACCURACY**: CLAUDE.md reflects actual system status

## DOING (Active Work)

- [ ] #775: CMAKE build failure - compiler_arena.mod missing  
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: Missing module dependency ordering in CMakeLists.txt  
  - **TECHNICAL EVIDENCE**: CMAKE fails with duplicate target errors  
  - **PRIORITY**: CRITICAL - blocks all CMAKE development

## SPRINT_BACKLOG - EMERGENCY RECOVERY

### EPIC: CRITICAL COMPILATION BLOCKERS

- [ ] **MOVED TO DOING** #775: CMAKE build failure - compiler_arena.mod missing

- [ ] #778: Duplicate symbol_info_t definitions cause compilation failure
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: Two incompatible symbol_info_t types in different files
  - **TECHNICAL EVIDENCE**: API mismatch between symbol_management.f90 and type definitions
  - **PRIORITY**: CRITICAL - blocks all semantic module compilation

- [ ] #776: FMP test suite failure - symbol_management.f90 compilation errors
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: symbol_info_t missing required fields (is_defined, scope_level)
  - **TECHNICAL EVIDENCE**: 30+ compilation errors in semantic modules
  - **PRIORITY**: CRITICAL - blocks all test execution

- [x] #773: semantic_query_api.f90 compilation failure - **COMPLETED IN PR #774** (mono_type_t API fix)

### EPIC: USER EXPERIENCE RECOVERY

- [ ] #779: fortfront executable UX failure - debug spam and --version broken
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: CLI interface produces debug output instead of user output
  - **TECHNICAL EVIDENCE**: fortfront --version outputs test program, not version
  - **PRIORITY**: HIGH - affects basic usability

### EPIC: DOCUMENTATION ACCURACY RECOVERY

- [ ] #783: CLAUDE.md accuracy crisis - systematic false claims
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: Documentation claims working systems that fail immediately
  - **TECHNICAL EVIDENCE**: CMAKE fails, error_stop count wrong, file sizes wrong
  - **PRIORITY**: MEDIUM - affects new contributor onboarding

### EPIC: ORGANIZATIONAL CLEANUP (Deferred to Sprint 7)

- [ ] #767: Confusing duplicate filename - constant_folding.f90 in two locations
  - **STATUS**: Non-critical, deferred until compilation blockers resolved

## DEFERRED TO ARCHITECTURAL RECOVERY SPRINT (Sprint 7)

**ARCHITECTURAL VIOLATIONS** (Post-Emergency Recovery):

- [ ] #782: 8 files severely exceed 1000-line architectural limit
  - **LARGEST VIOLATIONS**: parser_import_statements.f90 (1302 lines), variable_usage_tracker.f90 (1238 lines)
  - **TECHNICAL EVIDENCE**: find src -name "*.f90" -exec wc -l {} + | sort -nr shows 8 files >1000 lines
  - **DEFERRED**: Address after compilation system restored

- [ ] #788: Fundamental code organization principles systematically violated
  - **SCOPE**: Directory organization (26 items in src/), module extraction strategy
  - **IMPACT**: Long-term maintainability and scalability issues
  - **DEFERRED**: Requires working build system for safe refactoring
