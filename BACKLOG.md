# Development Backlog

## DOING (Current Work)

## SPRINT BACKLOG (Ordered by Priority)

### CRITICAL - Build System Recovery
- [ ] #540: Build system completely non-functional due to git commit error (BLOCKER - prevents all work)

### CRITICAL - System Functionality Blockers
- [ ] #517: fix: Issue #511 requires architectural analysis of multi-unit parsing (parser architecture)

### EPIC: Architecture Foundation Fixes
- [ ] #546: architectural drift: class(*) vtable linking issue #442 not resolved - blocking arena work
- [ ] #550: design misalignment: FPM-first architecture not validated - external tool integration untested
- [ ] #548: architectural gap: CST implementation incomplete - missing trivia preservation

### EPIC: Code Quality & Size Constraints
- [ ] #547: architectural violation: 12 files exceed 1000-line limit, violating size constraints
- [ ] #532: refactor: semantic_analyzer.f90 exceeds 1000 line limit (1036 lines)
- [ ] #535: refactor: parser_expressions.f90 exceeds 1000 line limit (1162 lines)
- [ ] #536: refactor: parser_declarations.f90 exceeds 1000 line limit (1460 lines)
- [ ] #533: refactor: infer_type function exceeds 100 line limit (106 lines)

### EPIC: Error Handling & Safety
- [ ] #539: refactor: replace error_stop with proper error handling
- [ ] #528: refactor: improve error handling in parse_unary function
- [ ] #541: I/O parsing edge case: unit_spec returns empty string for invalid unit specifiers
- [ ] #542: Undefined variable detection edge case: auto-declaration in strict mode leak

### EPIC: Parser & Type System Defects
- [ ] #543: CST to AST converter strips trivia by default breaking comment preservation
- [ ] #544: Multi-unit parsing: fixed array size limit causes silent failures for large files
- [ ] #545: Logical operator precedence: left-associative parsing may cause incorrect evaluation order
- [ ] #489: Code generation: Multiple program main blocks generated for mixed constructs
- [ ] #490: String parsing: Escaped single quotes not handled correctly
- [ ] #491: Type inference: Large integers not properly handled for overflow
- [ ] #487: Array literal: Nested arrays incorrectly typed as 1D instead of 2D
- [ ] #494: Array parsing: Array slice assignment with stride produces empty program
- [ ] #496: Loop parsing: Array assignment in do loop generates unparsed comment

### EPIC: Test Suite Optimization
- [ ] #549: performance debt: test suite still has massive duplication - 230 tests despite consolidation claims
- [ ] #500: refactor: massive test consolidation opportunity - reduce tests by ~85%
- [ ] #481: critical: CI/CD performance crisis - tests causing excessive runtime with massive duplication
- [ ] #504: refactor: consolidate redundant AST arena test patterns
- [ ] #505: refactor: eliminate test categories with overlapping functionality
- [ ] #527: test: add dedicated test for issue #493 logical operator precedence

### EPIC: Dead Code & Cleanup
- [ ] #534: cleanup: remove unused imports in semantic_analyzer.f90
- [ ] #537: cleanup: remove placeholder types in compiler_arena.f90
- [ ] #538: cleanup: remove commented-out code in memory modules

### EPIC: System Integrity
- [ ] #479: regression: call graph analysis multiple failures - unused procedure detection broken
- [ ] #480: regression: module parsing structure not preserved in test_module_parsing_bug_red
- [ ] #467: fix: call graph test failures in main branch
- [ ] #468: fix: AST transformation test failures in main branch

### EPIC: Enhancement Backlog
- [ ] #511: enhancement: mixed constructs - allow also implicit module above explicit program

### EPIC: Documentation Consolidation
- [ ] #551: docs: consolidate sprint defect fixes and architectural improvements
