# FortFront roadmap

FortFront owns parsing, semantic resolution, typed public queries, and
diagnostics for the ffc pipeline. It must remain backend-neutral: when ffc
needs a missing fact, fix or specify the public query here rather than exposing
private arena layout or adding an ffc text-name workaround.

## Current handoff (2026-08-03)

- `main` is `5ff071849c2e6c8bffaa9b19088a1592c870a418`.
- The parser and semantic changes used by the current ffc tranche are on
  `main`; focused builds pass at the recorded baseline, while the full
  downstream ffc suite still has unrelated known failures.
- The maintained rejection workflow is mandatory. A rejection change must
  prove that intended invalid cases are rejected and that valid corpus files
  are not newly rejected.

## Active blockers and cross-references

- [#2883](https://github.com/lazy-fortran/fortfront/issues/2883) defines the
  explicit-interface rejection contract. Coordinate its serial landing with
  ffc [#584](https://github.com/lazy-fortran/ffc/issues/584).
- [#2924](https://github.com/lazy-fortran/fortfront/issues/2924) owns the
  rejection corpus gate. It is the safety gate for all later rejection issues
  and for ffc [#663](https://github.com/lazy-fortran/ffc/issues/663).
- [#2951](https://github.com/lazy-fortran/fortfront/issues/2951) protects valid
  programs from semantic over-tightening; ffc must not paper over regressions.
- [#2994](https://github.com/lazy-fortran/fortfront/issues/2994) is the current
  Lazy specialization ABI blocker and is coupled to ffc [#437](https://github.com/lazy-fortran/ffc/issues/437)
  and [#433](https://github.com/lazy-fortran/ffc/issues/433).
- The silent-source-drop family (#2966, #2967, #2972, #2974, and #2977) needs
  structural scanner coverage, not isolated corpus-only exceptions.

## Delivery gate

Each change needs an independent parser/semantic or compiler-behavior oracle,
the focused tests, the rejection gate when diagnostics change, and the full
repository `fo` pipeline. Update this file when a linked issue or public query
changes state.
