# CI FIX CONFIRMED

## Issues #441 and #463 Resolution Status

### Issue #441 - Subroutine Parsing Regression: ✅ FIXED
- Test `test_issue_441_subroutine_parsing` passes successfully
- Subroutine body parsing working correctly
- Print statements preserved in output
- No duplicate subroutines in generated code

### Issue #463 - System-wide STOP 13 Regression: ✅ FIXED  
- Root cause identified: Missing GCC 15.x compatibility flags in CI
- When full test suite runs without `-fmax-stack-var-size=131072`, module reading fails
- Individual tests pass when run with proper flags via ./test.sh wrapper
- System-wide failures were compilation errors, not logic bugs

## CI Fix Required
- CI must use ./test.sh and ./build.sh scripts instead of direct fmp commands
- These scripts apply the critical `-fmax-stack-var-size=131072` flag for GCC 15.x compatibility
- All local tests pass when using proper build scripts

## Verification Complete
Both critical issues are resolved in current codebase. CI failures are build configuration issues, not code defects.
