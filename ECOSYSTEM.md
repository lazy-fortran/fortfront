# Fortran Ecosystem Architecture

A next-generation Fortran toolchain built on static linking with zero dependencies, delivering industrial-strength capabilities and world-class developer experience.

## Core Architecture Principles

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Static linking everywhere**: Self-contained executables, no dynamic dependency hell
- **Clean tool separation**: Each tool has single clear purpose except fo
- **fortfront foundation FIRST**: All other tools depend on this solid base
- **fo as universal orchestrator**: Contains everything, provides integrated experience

## Foundation Layer: fortfront

**The Immutable Foundation** - Single .a static library, zero dependencies

```
fortfront.a        # Foundation library (static linking only)
├── CST/AST split for source fidelity + semantic analysis
├── Arena-based memory management with generations
├── Hindley-Milner type inference system
├── Lazy-fortran (.lf) to standard Fortran transformation
├── Plugin architecture with stable interfaces
└── Fortran module interfaces for external tool integration
```

**Build Output**: Single `libfortfront.a` file
**Dependencies**: ZERO - completely self-contained
**API**: Fortran module interfaces for type-safe integration
**Memory**: Arena-based allocation for 10x+ performance
**Safety**: Generation-based handles prevent use-after-free

## Individual Tools Layer

**Clean, Focused Tools** - Each statically links fortfront only

├── ALL fpm functionality + comprehensive enhancements
├── Smart tool orchestration and workflow automation
├── Project lifecycle management with caching
├── Backward compatible with fpm commands
└── Single 50MB executable, zero external dependencies
```

### Core fo Commands (fpm Compatible)
```bash
# Standard fpm commands (enhanced)
fo new project             # Smart project initialization
fo build                   # Enhanced build with caching
fo test                    # Testing with coverage integration
fo install                 # Enhanced package management
fo run main.lf             # Execute with fortrun enhancement

# Extended tool integration
fo analyze                 # fluff static analysis
fo format                  # fluff code formatting
fo compile -O3 main.lf     # ffc high-performance compilation
fo notebook process.lf     # fortnb notebook processing
fo coverage --diff HEAD~1  # fortcov coverage analysis

# Workflow orchestration
fo dev                     # Development mode with hot-reload
fo ci                      # Complete CI/CD pipeline
fo release                 # Full release workflow with versioning
```

### Dual .lf Compilation Strategy

**Single-File .lf (ffc)**:
```bash
ffc main.lf                # Direct compilation, local inference only
# - Uses fortfront only
# - Fast compilation for simple programs
# - No cross-module analysis
```

**Multi-File .lf (fo)**:
```bash
fo run main.lf             # Enhanced compilation via fortrun
# - Uses fortfront + fortrun
# - Cross-module type inference
# - Smart caching and dependency tracking
# - Project-aware compilation
```

## Tool Integration Strategies

### Standalone Tool Usage (Specialists)
```bash
# Individual tools for focused workflows
fluff analyze src/ --strict                # Pure static analysis
ffc main.lf -O3                           # Single-file compilation
fortnb process notebook.lf                 # Notebook processing
fortcov --format=json --baseline=main      # Coverage analysis
fortrun physics_sim.lf                     # Enhanced execution
```

### Unified Usage (Primary Workflow)
```bash
# fo for integrated development experience
fo new my_project                          # Project initialization
fo run physics_sim.lf                      # Enhanced execution
fo analyze --fix                           # Analysis with auto-fix
fo test --coverage                         # Testing with coverage
fo format src/                             # Code formatting
fo compile -O3 main.lf                     # Optimized compilation
fo release --semantic-version              # Complete release workflow
```

### VSCode Integration

## File Extensions and Language Evolution

### .lf Extension (Lazy Fortran)
**Revolutionary Simplification**: Write minimal Fortran with maximum power

```fortran
! experiment.lf (lazy fortran)
x = 2
y = 3.14
name = "Alice"
print *, x + y, name

! Compiles to:
! program main
!     implicit none
!     integer :: x
!     real :: y  
!     character(len=5) :: name
!     x = 2
!     y = 3.14
!     name = "Alice"
!     print *, x + y, name
! end program
```

**Dual Compilation Strategy**:
- **ffc**: Single-file .lf with local type inference (fast, simple)
- **fo**: Multi-file .lf with cross-module inference (full power)

### Editor Integration Strategy
**Single Point of Truth**: VSCode extension integrates with fo only

```json
{
  "fortran.languageServer": "fo lsp",
  "fortran.fileExtensions": [".f90", ".f95", ".f03", ".f08", ".lf"],
  "fortran.lazyFortranSupport": true,
  "fortran.staticLinking": true
}
```

## Strategic Vision

**Position Fortran as a Modern Language** with development experience comparable to:

### Go-like Simplicity
```bash
fo run physics.lf           # "go run" equivalent
fo build                    # "go build" equivalent  
fo test                     # "go test" equivalent
```

### Rust-like Toolchain Integration
```bash
fo new project              # "cargo new" equivalent
fo add dependency           # "cargo add" equivalent
fo check                    # "cargo check" equivalent
```

### Python-like Scientific Focus
```bash
fo notebook run analysis.lf # Jupyter notebook equivalent
fo plot data.lf            # Scientific computing focus
```

### Key Differentiators
- **Zero Dependencies**: No npm/pip/cargo registry complexity
- **Static Linking**: No library version conflicts ever
- **Lazy Fortran**: Minimal syntax with full Fortran power
- **Universal Compiler Support**: Works with any Fortran compiler
- **Industrial Strength**: Built for HPC and scientific computing

## Migration Strategy

### For New Users
1. **Install**: Single fo executable, zero setup
2. **Learn**: Start with .lf files for immediate productivity
3. **Grow**: Gradually learn standard Fortran features
4. **Scale**: Use full project capabilities as needed

### For Tool Developers
1. **Foundation**: Build on fortfront static library
2. **Integration**: Use fo's plugin architecture
